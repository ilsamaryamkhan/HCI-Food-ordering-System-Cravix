#  **Cravix – GIKI Food Ordering System (HCI Project)**

##  **Overview**

Cravix is a high-fidelity food ordering system created for the **Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute (GIKI)** community.
Because GIKI is located in Topi far from major cities. Students and faculty rely heavily on on-campus hotels like **Raju, Ayan, Hot & Spicy**, and nearby vendors in **Topi/Ghazi**.

But the current system is **manual and phone-based**, resulting in:

* Wrong orders
* Network issues inside hostels
* No menu visibility
* No real-time delivery tracking
* Delays due to miscommunication

Cravix solves this by providing a **centralized, app-based ordering platform** similar to Foodpanda—designed using HCI principles like learnability, efficiency, and visibility.

This repository contains the **Milestone 3 High-Fidelity Prototype PDF** and documentation.
